# Mobius Strip Modeling

A beginner-friendly Python project that models a 3D Möbius strip using parametric equations. Includes surface mesh generation, numerical surface area approximation, edge length calculation, and 3D visualization using Matplotlib.

## 🌀 Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

- Use parametric equations to define a Möbius strip
- Generate a 3D mesh of (x, y, z) points on the surface
- Approximate surface area using numerical integration
- Calculate edge length of the strip
- Visualize the strip in 3D with Matplotlib

## 📁 Project Structure
mobius_strip.py # Main script with MobiusStrip class
README.md # Project documentation

## 🧠 Parametric Equations Used
x(u,v) = (R + v * cos(u/2)) * cos(u)
y(u,v) = (R + v * cos(u/2)) * sin(u)
z(u,v) = v * sin(u/2)


Where:
- u ∈ [0, 2π]
- v ∈ [−w/2, w/2]

## 📝 Write-Up

### How I Structured the Code
The code is organized into a `MobiusStrip` class with methods for mesh generation, surface area calculation, edge length, and visualization. All parameters (radius, width, resolution) are configurable.

### How I Approximated Surface Area
The surface area is estimated by calculating partial derivatives of the mesh and using the cross product to compute local area elements, which are then summed across the grid.

### Challenges I Faced
As a beginner, understanding `meshgrid`, gradients, and 3D plotting was a challenge. Breaking down the equations and writing modular, readable code helped manage the complexity.

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

### 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
